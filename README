This package includes the following programs.

* quine-gen.rb ... A simple command to generate a Quine from a banner.

===========
BASIC USAGE
===========

shell> jbanner.rb -f "path_to_font.bdf" \
ここに テキストを 書いて ください |\
quine-gen.rb -s 2 | ruby | ruby

You should pass the output to ruby twice in order to ensure that the output is
really a quine. If the banner is too short, the ruby program will fail with a
Syntax error. You can workaround a problem by increasing the scale factor.

============
CYCLIC QUINE
============

This toolkit can generate cyclic quine, which produces B by executing by A,
produces C by executing B, D, E and so forth, then back to A again.

shell> jbanner.rb -f "path_to_font.bdf" -s ===\
渋谷 === 新宿 === 池袋|\
quine-gen.rb -x 4 -y 2 -p === > stations.rb

shell> ruby stations.rb                        # 渋谷
shell> ruby stations.rb | ruby                 # 新宿
shell> ruby stations.rb | ruby | ruby          # 池袋
shell> ruby stations.rb | ruby | ruby | ruby   # 渋谷 again
