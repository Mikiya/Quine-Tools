shell> jbanner.rb -f "path_to_font.bdf" \

quine-gen.rb -s 2 | ruby | ruby

You should pass the output to ruby twice in order to ensure that the output is
really a quine. If the banner is too short, the ruby program will fail with a
Syntax error. You can workaround a problem by increasing the scale factor.

Refer to --help for more information.

Enjoy!
